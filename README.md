# Prime Factorizer
My very basic implementation of a prime factorization algorithm.
Might actually expand it and make it part of a Least Common Multiple algorithm implementation.

NOTE: I've just noticed that the binaries are a bit old, forgot to recompile the thing before uploading them. Recompiling the thing is highly recommended.
I'll recompile and reupload the binaries in a few days tho.
