# Prime Factorizer
My very basic implementation of a prime factorization algorithm.
Might actually expand it and make it part of a Least Common Multiple algorithm implementation.

NOTE: I've just noticed that the binaries are a bit old, forgot to recompile the thing before uploading them. Recompiling the thing is highly recommended.
I'll recompile and reupload the binaries in a few days tho.

NOTE: I might forget to merge the dev branch to master, so please use that one to make use of the improvements. I haven't tested it yet, but according to my sixth sense it should work without concerns. Always feel free to open an issue for everything you might be experiencing.
